        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          We’re a passionate team driven by creativity, sustainability, and
          technology, dedicated to designing digital experiences that connect
          people and inspire positive change. Through Nativ, we empower
          individuals to restore biodiversity by offering personalized,
          AI-guided recommendations on native plants suited to their
          environment. Our mission is to make sustainable gardening accessible
          to everyone helping homeowners and city dwellers alike become active
          stewards of their ecosystems. Together, we’re building a movement to
          combat deforestation and monoculture, one native plant at a time.
